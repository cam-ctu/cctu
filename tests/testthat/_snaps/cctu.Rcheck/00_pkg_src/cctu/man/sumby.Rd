\title{Produces summary statistics on a variable broken down by arm, display a
graphical equivalent.}
\usage{
sumby(
  variable,
  arm,
  label = NULL,
  data = parent.frame(),
  total = TRUE,
  fig = TRUE,
  directory = file.path(getOption("cctu_output", default = "Output"), "Figures"),
  verbose = options()$verbose,
  text_clean = propercase,
  pct_digits = 0,
  delete = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{A variable of interest to be summarised. Works for several
classes: numeric, integer, factor, character.}

\item{arm}{A variable to break down the summary by, typically an arm in a
RCT. Or a constant variable for 1-armed study}

\item{label}{a text string to label the variable by, used to add in units
or full words with spaces rather than acronyms. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{data}{optional a data frame, or envirnoment, in which to find the
variable and arm values. Defaults to parent.frame()}

\item{total}{logical value to include an extra overall columns. Defaults
to true}

\item{fig}{logical value on whether to print (if interactive) and save a
copy of the figure. Defaults to true}

\item{directory}{the path to the directory where figures will be saved as
"sumby_XX_Y.png". XX is taken from the current table numer (or "0") set
in \code{\link{attach_pop}}, and the Y is counting how many time \code{\link{sumby}} has been run since the XX was last set.}

\item{verbose}{logical to print information on changes to the global
environment or external files. Defaults to options()$verbose.}

\item{text_clean}{a function to transform character labels. Defaults to
propercase. Or set to NULL if you want to preserve the original text.}

\item{pct_digits}{number of decimal places to present percentages to.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{delete}{levels of the input variable that should be removed from
the output table, in the case of frequency tables. Can be useful for a
binary variable if you just want the rate of "yes" for example.}
}
\value{
a data.frame containing summary statistics in character format,
ready to use with write_table(). Plus an attribute "fig" that contains
 a ggplot object
