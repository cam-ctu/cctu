\title{Render continuous values for table output.}
\usage{
render_numeric(x, what = "Median [Min, Max]", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{what}{A character or vector what will be reported for numeric
variables, default is median and min, max. See \code{\link{num_stat}}
for the supported statistics. The provided name will be used
as statistic names (printed in the table), and the values is the statistics
that will be reported. If you want to have a fancy name, use a named
vector with names as the statistics will be printed and values are the
statistics. For example, \code{c("Geo. Mean (Geo. CV\%)" = "GMean (GCV)",
"Median [IQR]" = "Median [Q1, Q3]")}. In the latter case, the user visible
statistics will be called \code{"Median [IQR]"} and this is the name printed.
But the underlying summarised statistics are median, Q1 and Q3.
Separate statistics with comma or a space or any non-letters.}

\item{...}{Further arguments, passed to \code{\link{num_stat}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{character} vector. Each element is to be displayed in a
separate cell in the table. The \code{\link{names}} of the vector are the
labels to use in the table.
}
\description{
Called from \code{\link{cttab}} by default to render continuous (i.e.
\code{numeric}) values for displaying in the table.
}
\details{
This function was used by \code{link{cttab}} to render numeric variables.
It essentially uses the values returned by \code{\link{num_stat}} and
put values to a vector.

\examples{
x <- exp(rnorm(100, 1, 1))
