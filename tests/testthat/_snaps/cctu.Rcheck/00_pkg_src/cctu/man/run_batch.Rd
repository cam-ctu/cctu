\description{
This function is to allow R CMD BATCH to be called interactively, without
needing to start up a command line terminal and change directories etc.
It calls the R CMD BATCH from the current working directory. Hence its value
 is in producing the side-effects: whatever happens when the script is run.
Plus a log file will be created in the working directory with the same name
as the script but with the suffix changed to '.Rout'.
}
\details{
The command will not run in environments where \code{\link{interactive}}
is false, so as to prevent infinite loops.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{BATCH}} and \code{rcmd} from the callr package,
which might already do this....

\code{check_failures} from the devtools package for future ideas
 for a function to check the log file for errors or warnings.
