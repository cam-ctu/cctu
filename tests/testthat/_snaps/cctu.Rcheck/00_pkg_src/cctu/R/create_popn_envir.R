#' create environments contain a set of data frames filtered for each population
#'
#' @param data_names a character vector of the key data frames to be filtered
#' @param popn a data frame one-row per participant  a subjid variable and a
#' column for each population indicating if a participant belongs to the
#' population. The names of the variables must match up to the values in
#' meta_table$Population.
#' @param subjid_string the character naming the column used in each data frame
#'  from data_names and popn, to identify the subjid.
#' @param rm_from_frame a logical indicating if the data sets should be removed
#' from the frame environment
#' @param frame the frame in which the original list of data sets are found,
#' and  in which the new environments will be contained.
#' @param verbose logical to print information on changes to the global
#' environment or external files. Defaults to options()$verbose.
#'
#' @details  Now to use the data frames defined above in data_names you have to
#'  either directly call attach(safety), for example or look-up with
#'  attach_pop(1.01) for a table number. There are separate R environments made
#'   for each of the populations in population & population_title be careful to
#'    use detach(safety) - this is automated with write_table() and
#'    write_ggplot()
